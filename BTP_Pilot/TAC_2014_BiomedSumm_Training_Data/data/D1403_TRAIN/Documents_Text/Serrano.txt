Abstract
Oncogenic ras can transform most immortal rodent cells to a tumorigenic state. However, transformation of primary cells by ras requires either a cooperating oncogene or the inactivation of tumor suppressors such as p53 or p16. Here we show that expression of oncogenic ras in primary human or rodent cells results in a permanent G1 arrest. The arrest induced by ras is accompanied by accumulation of p53 and p16, and is phenotypically indistinguishable from cellular senescence. Inactivation of either p53 or p16 prevents ras-induced arrest in rodent cells, and E1A achieves a similar effect in human cells. These observations suggest that the onset of cellular senescence does not simply reflect the accumulation of cell divisions, but can be prematurely activated in response to an oncogenic stimulus. Negation of ras-induced senescence may be relevant during multistep tumorigenesis.

Introduction
The ras family of proto-oncogenes encodes small GTP-binding proteins that transduce mitogenic signals from tyrosine-kinase receptors (reviewed by 5 and 10). Amplification of ras proto-oncogenes and mutations that constitutively activate Ras proteins are frequent in human cancers (reviewed by Bos 1988). Oncogenic ras efficiently transforms most immortal rodent cell lines but fails to transform primary cells ( Newbold and Overell 1983). ras cooperates, however, with certain other oncogenic alterations to transform primary rodent cells ( 35 and 56), including overexpression of c-Myc, dominant negative p53, D-type cyclins, and Cdc25A and -B, and loss of p53, p16, or IRF-1 (reviewed by 70 and 57; see also Hinds et al. 1994; 38, 66, 17 and 60). Several viral oncoproteins also cooperate with ras, including SV40 T-antigen, adenovirus E1A, human papillomavirus E7, and HTLV-1 Tax ( 70 and 57). When expressed alone, most of these cooperating alterations facilitate the establishment of primary cells into immortal cell lines ( Ruley 1990). Oncogenic transformation of primary cells by coexpression of ras and “immortalizing” mutations constitutes a model of multistep tumorigenesis that has been reproduced in animal systems (reviewed by 30 and 68; see also Kemp et al. 1993).

Together with ras mutations, inactivation of the tumor suppressors p53 and p16 are the most prevalent mutations in human tumors (reviewed by 27 and 29). Mice with p53 gene deletions develop normally but are highly prone to tumor development ( 13 and 31). Indeed, p53 is not required for normal cell growth, but acts to prevent proliferation under circumstances of cellular stress. Hence, the normally low levels of p53 increase following DNA damage, certain oncogenic insults, hypoxia, and a variety of other cellular stresses (reviewed by Ko and Prives 1996). Activation of p53 prevents cell proliferation by inducing either cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis. A variety of factors determine the probability of a particular outcome, including cell type, Rb activity, ectopic expression of certain oncogenes, and levels of proteins such as Bax, Bcl-2, and others ( Ko and Prives 1996; see also 40 and 44). p53 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that activates transcription of genes involved in cell-cycle arrest and in apoptosis. The expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21 is transcriptionally activated by p53 and contributes to p53-dependent arrest ( Ko and Prives 1996).

p16INK4a encodes a protein that associates with CDK4 and inhibits its activity ( 58 and 73), and is mutated in a wide variety of cancers (reviewed by Hirama and Koeffler 1995). Like p53, p16 has no obvious role in normal development or intrinsic cell-cycle control but is a potent tumor suppressor. Hence, p16-deficient mice are viable but highly prone to spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumors ( Serrano et al. 1996). The primary function of the CDK4/cyclin D kinases is to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, Rb, allowing progression of the cell-cycle toward S phase (reviewed by 62 and 71). Thus, expression of p16 inhibits CDK4/D kinases and leads to G1 arrest, but is inconsequential in the absence of functional Rb. In contrast to p53, little is known about the regulation of p16 expression or activity, or about circumstances in which p16 might act physiologically to promote cell-cycle arrest.

Primary murine fibroblasts lacking either p53 or p16 are transformed by oncogenic ras alone ( 66 and 60) and are easily established into immortal cell lines ( 22, 45 and 60). In human cells, inactivation of p53 and/or p16 also facilitates the immortalization process ( Reznikoff et al. 1996; Rogan et al. 1996). Together, these observations suggest a role for p53 and p16 in cellular senescence and, consistent with this, p53, p21, and p16 levels and/or activity increase in senescent cells ( 2, 20 and 52). In this study, we demonstrate that prolonged expression of oncogenic ras induces a cell-cycle arrest involving p53 and p16 that is indistinguishable from cellular senescence. We suggest that premature senescence is a mechanism of tumor suppression that can explain several aspects of ras transformation and may be an important safeguard against neoplasia.

Results
Oncogenic ras Provokes Cell Arrest
We chose three well-characterized systems to examine the effects of oncogenic ras in normal cells: primary (presenescent) human diploid fibroblasts (IMR90 and WI38), primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), and the rat REF52 cell line. REF52 cells are immortal fibroblasts but are similar to primary cells in that they display a high degree of growth control and require coexpression of a cooperating oncogene for transformation by ras ( Franza et al. 1986). An activated ras allele (H-ras V12) was introduced into these cells using recombinant replication-deficient retroviruses as described in Experimental Procedures. The percentage of retrovirally transduced cells ranged between 60% and 100%, as estimated in parallel infections using viruses expressing the lacZ gene product. The retroviral vectors coexpressed a puromycin phosphotransferase gene that allowed selection for pure populations of transduced cells within four days. The fifth day postinfection is designated day 0 in all the following experiments ( Figure 1). Using this protocol, we observed an approximate 5- to 10-fold increase in total Ras protein, compared to endogenous Ras levels (data not shown).

Expression of H-ras V12 produced morphological changes in human IMR90 and WI38 cells. Initially, cells displayed a refractile cytoplasm with thin and long projections (data not shown). By day 2, a significant proportion of H-ras V12-transduced cells became flat and enlarged; by day 6, virtually all cells had acquired the enlarged morphology and apparently were growth arrested ( Figure 2A; data not shown for WI38). Similar changes in cell morphology were observed in primary MEFs and REF52 cells ( Figure 2A; data not shown for WI38). No changes in morphology were detected in cell populations transduced with empty viral vector ( Figure 2A).

Cells were stained with FITC-anti-BrdU to detect BrdU incorporation (vertical axis) and propidium iodide to detect total DNA (horizontal axis). The upper box identifies cells incorporating BrdU (∼S phase), the lower-left box identifies G0/G1 cells, and the lower-right box displays G2/M cells. The percentage of cells incorporating BrdU is indicated in the upper left of each graph.

The proliferative properties of such cell populations were monitored by growth curves and by BrdU-labeling, followed by flow cytometry. Cells transduced with H-ras V12 or with empty vector were plated at low density and cell numbers were counted ( Figure 2B; data not shown for WI38 cells). Control populations grew steadily and reached confluence by day 6 ( Figure 2A and Figure 2B). By contrast, H-ras V12-transduced cells stopped accumulating well before reaching confluence ( Figure 2A and Figure 2B). BrdU incorporation combined with DNA-content analysis revealed that H-ras V12-transduced populations retained a small percentage of BrdU-positive cells at day 1, but virtually none by day 3 ( Figure 2C). H-ras V12-transduced cells accumulated preferentially in G1, with a cell-cycle profile indistinguishable from serum-starved control cells ( Figure 2C; data not shown). The proportion of BrdU-positive cells in control populations was high, and declined only when cells reached confluence between days 3 and 5 ( Figure 2C). Similarly, MEFs and REF52 cell populations transduced with H-ras V12 displayed reduced BrdU incorporation compared to vector-transduced controls (see below). Hence, the inability of the H-ras V12-transduced cells to proliferate is primarily due to cell-cycle arrest rather than cell death. Cells arrested by oncogenic ras remained attached to the plates and retained the same flat and enlarged morphology for at least one month (data not shown). Thus, ras induces cell-cycle arrest prior to the onset of S phase, and this program is conserved between human and rodent fibroblasts.

Cell-Cycle Proteins
To characterize the nature of the cell-cycle arrest caused by H-ras V12, we examined the expression of several cell-cycle regulatory proteins by immunoblotting ( Figure 3A). Cell lysates were prepared between days 2 and 4. In all three experimental systems, oncogenic ras resulted in elevated p53 and p21. Furthermore, oncogenic ras also increased p16 levels. On average, p53, p21, and p16 increases ranged between 10- and 20-fold, compared to control cells and relative to the total cellular protein content. Declines in the levels of hyperphosphorylated Rb, cyclin A, and CDK2 kinase activity were also observed in H-ras V12-transduced cells ( Figure 3A and Figure 3B). Moderate increases in the levels of cyclin D1 were also observed in the presence of H-ras V12 (data not shown), in agreement with previous reports using immortal cell lines ( Liu et al. 1995).

Decreases in the abundance of hyperphosphorylated Rb, cyclin A, and CDK2 activity are characteristic features of G0/G1 arrest; for example, during quiescence as a result of serum-starvation or confluence (seeDulic et al. 1993). By contrast, neither p53 nor p16 accumulate during quiescence (1 and 2). Consequently, the G1 arrest induced by oncogenic ras is different from quiescence and is specifically characterized by the simultaneous induction of the p53 and p16 tumor suppressor proteins.

Cellular Senescence
The features of H-ras V12-arrested cells described above are remarkably similar to cells that have surpassed their proliferative capacity and become senescent ( Hayflick and Moorhead 1961). For example, senescent cells adopt a flat enlarged morphology and cease proliferation at subconfluent densities despite the presence of serum (reviewed by 63 and 69). Also, senescent cells arrest with a G1 DNA content, and express increased levels and/or activity of p53, p21, and p16 ( 49, 3, 2, 20 and 52). To exlore further the potential relationship between ras-induced arrest and senescence, we examined three additional senescence-associated markers: lack of serum-dependent induction of c-fos ( Seshadri and Campisi 1990), overexpression of the plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) gene ( 19 and 47), and detection of a senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) optimally active at a pH of 6.0 ( Dimri et al. 1995; see also Reznikoff et al. 1996).

To test induction of c-fos mRNA, IMR90 cells transduced with H-ras V12 or with empty vector were serum starved from days 0 to 4, and then restimulated with serum. As expected, vector-transduced cells transiently induced c-fos 30 min after restimulation ( Figure 4A). No c-fos message was detected, however, in H-ras V12-transduced cells ( Figure 4A). PAI-1 regulates cell-extracellular matrix interactions and is translated from two mRNAs. During senescence, both PAI-1 transcripts become elevated, but the increase in expression of the small transcript is more pronounced ( Mu and Higgins 1995). Likewise, H-ras V12-transduced IMR90 cells displayed a significant accumulation of PAI-1 mRNA, compared with vector-transduced cells (2.5-fold large transcript; 7.5-fold small transcript) ( Figure 4B).

At day 0 (see Figure 1), cultures were serum-deprived (s.d.) in 0.5% serum for 96 hr and then restimulated by addition of 10% serum. At the indicated times after restimulation, total RNA was prepared and probed with c-fos and GAPDH as a loading control. The c-fos probe crossreacted with 28S ribosomal RNA.

The SA-β-gal activity was assessed at several times postinfection (Figure 4C). The percentage of SA-β-gal-positive cells in H-ras V12-expressing populations was initially low, but increased at day 3 and reached 60% by day 6 ( Figure 4C and Figure 4D). In contrast, about 3% of the IMR90 cells in control cultures were SA-β-gal positive, a value consistent with that previously described for young IMR90 cells ( Dimri et al. 1995). Cell-cycle arrest produced by serum depletion or confluence produced no increase in the percentage of SA-β-gal-positive cells in IMR90 control cells ( Figure 4C and data not shown). Thus, the cell-cycle arrest induced by oncogenic ras was identical to replicative senescence by every criterion tested.

E1A Bypass of Arrest
In rodent fibroblasts, the adenovirus E1A oncogene cooperates with H-ras V12 to transform primary cells oncogenically ( Ruley 1983). To determine whether E1A could circumvent ras-induced cell-cycle arrest, E1A was transduced into MEF, REF52, and IMR90 cell populations using a vector coexpressing E1A 12S and hygromycin phosphotransferase. After selection in hygromycin, E1A-expressing cells were infected with an H-ras V12-expressing or control virus, according to the scheme in Figure 1. In each cell type, E1A-expressing fibroblasts transduced with H-ras V12 incorporated BrdU with efficiencies comparable to those of cells transduced with empty vector, and proliferated rapidly ( Figure 5 and Figure 6). These results indicate that E1A efficiently negates the cell-cycle arrest induced by oncogenic ras, and are consistent with the observation that E1A cooperates with ras in transformation assays. Importantly, the levels of H-Ras proteins following introduction of H-ras V12 were similar between parental and E1A-expressing cells (data not shown), demonstrating that overexpression of H-ras V12 is not necessarily detrimental to cell proliferation.

Both MEF and IMR90 cells expressing E1A alone displayed a normal rate of BrdU incorporation, but cell numbers accumulated slowly (compare Figure 5A and Figure 5C with Figure 6A and Figure 6C, respectively). This discrepancy presumably reflects a high rate of apoptosis occurring in the E1A-expressing cells ( Lowe et al. 1994). Notably, primary MEFs and REF52 cells expressing E1A were morphologically altered and appeared oncogenically transformed following introduction of H-ras V12 (data not shown). E1A also altered the morphology of IMR90 cells. In contrast to rodent cells, however, IMR90 cells expressing E1A and transduced with H-ras V12 remained growing as monolayers and displayed no indication of neoplastic transformation (see Figure 7B).

Disruption of p53 or p16/Rb Pathways
To examine the independent contribution of p53 and p16 to ras-induced cell-cycle arrest, the response of wild-type MEFs to oncogenic ras was compared to otherwise identical MEFs derived from p53- or p16-deficient mice ( 31 and 60). In contrast to wild-type MEFs, p53−/− or p16−/− MEFs continued to incorporate BrdU and proliferate following introduction of H-ras V12 ( Figure 5A and Figure 6A). In agreement with previous reports ( 66 and 60), both p53−/− and p16−/− MEFs expressing H-ras V12 displayed features of oncogenic transformation (e.g., refractile morphology, loss of contact inhibition), which were apparent almost immediately after H-ras V12 was transduced (data not shown). These results indicate that p53 and p16 are essential for ras-induced arrest in MEFs, and that inactivation of either p53 or p16 alone is sufficient to circumvent arrest.

In REF52 and IMR90 fibroblasts, a different approach was needed to disrupt p53 or the p16/Rb pathway. To inactivate p53 specifically, we transduced p53 175H, a dominant-negative p53 mutant, in the same manner as was described for E1A (see Experimental Procedures). Transduction of dominant-negative p53 inactivated endogenous p53, as judged by its ability to abolish p21 expression (data not shown). To disrupt the p16/Rb pathway, we sequentially transduced cyclin D1 and CDK4 R24C using different selectable markers (see Experimental Procedures). CDK4 R24C is a mutant CDK4 protein insensitive to p16 ( Wölfel et al. 1995), and cooperates with cyclin D1 to prevent cell-cycle arrest induced by p16 overexpression ( Bartkova et al. 1996; J. Koh and E. Harlow, personal communication). The cyclin D1/CDK4 R24C complexes are expected to inactivate the p16/Rb pathway by phosphorylating Rb in a p16-insensitive manner, and possibly by sequestering other cell-cycle inhibitors such as p21 and p27.

Disruption of p53 activity compromised ras-induced arrest in REF52 cells but not in IMR90 cells. Specifically, REF52/p53 175H populations transduced with H-ras V12 showed a partial decrease in BrdU incorporation at day 2, but eventually outgrew the vector-transduced REF52/p53 175H ( Figure 5B and Figure 6B). Concordant with previously published results ( Hicks et al. 1991), REF52 cells coexpressing mutant p53 and ras appeared morphologically transformed (data not shown). In contrast, IMR90/p53 175H cells transduced with H-ras V12 underwent cell-cycle arrest and displayed the large flat morphology characteristic of the parental cells expressing H-ras V12 alone ( Figure 5C and Figure 6C, and data not shown). Thus, whereas p53 is essential for ras-induced arrest in rodent fibroblasts, it appears dispensable in human fibroblasts.

Similarly, disruption of the p16/Rb pathway by cyclin D1/CDK4 R24C allowed escape from ras-induced arrest in REF52 but not in IMR90 fibroblasts. Hence, in agreement with the behavior of p16−/− MEFs, REF52 cells coexpressing cyclin D1 and p16-insensitive CDK4 R24C continued incorporating BrdU and proliferating upon introduction of H-ras V12 ( Figure 5B and Figure 6B). Moreover, these cells became small and refractile, and showed loss of contact inhibiton, which are both characteristics of neoplastic transformation (data not shown). In contrast, transfer of H-ras V12 into IMR90 populations coexpressing cyclin D1 and CDK4 R24C elicited the same changes in cell morphology and growth as in control IMR90 cells. Thus, cells became large and flat, and displayed a significant decrease in BrdU incorporation and growth rate ( Figure 5C and Figure 6C). In a parallel situation to that described for p53, disruption of the p16/Rb pathway is sufficient to prevent ras-induced arrest in rodent but not in human fibroblasts.

Absence of Senescence-Associated Markers in Cells Coexpressing E1A and Oncogenic ras
To test further the significance of the senescence markers induced by H-ras V12 in IMR90 cells (see above), we examined the behavior of these markers in IMR90 cells expressing E1A and transduced with H-ras V12. H-ras V12 failed to induce PAI-1 expression or SA-β-gal activity in IMR90 cells expressing E1A ( Figure 7A and Figure 7B). The response of c-fos to serum stimulation could not be assessed because E1A-expressing cells under-go apoptosis following serum depletion ( 39 and 41). These results indicate that overexpression of PAI-1 and the presence of SA-β-gal activity are not direct consequences of oncogenic ras, but rather are associated with the arrested state induced by ras. In this regard, our observations further strengthen the association of these markers with cellular senescence.

Discussion
The effect of ras on proliferation and tumorigenesis has been well documented in the context of immortal cell lines ( 5 and 10). However, the analysis of the effects of prolonged ras expression in primary cells has remained largely unexplored, mainly due to the limited lifespan of primary cells and to the low efficiencies of conventional gene transfer methods. Retrovirus-mediated gene-transfer allows the introduction of exogenous genes with high efficiencies, such that the effects of a transduced gene can be assessed in whole cell populations without significant expansion of the culture. We took advantage of these methods to study the effects of oncogenic ras in primary cells.

Cell-Cycle Arrest Induced by Oncogenic ras
We show that ras provokes a permanent cell-cycle arrest in primary fibroblasts of rodent and human origin. The arrest occurs at G1 and in association with a significant increase in the abundance of p53, p21, and p16. In this regard, oncogenic activation of ras constitutes a novel circumstance in which p53 is activated, and provides a description of a stimulus that can induce p16 in association with cell-cycle arrest. It has been previously reported that cells lacking functional Rb overexpress p16 ( 58 and 20). However, the absence of functional Rb renders the cells insensitive to p16 and cells proliferate in the face of high levels of p16 protein.

In rodent fibroblasts, disruption of either p53 or p16 alone is sufficient to prevent ras-induced arrest. p53 and p16 are not thought to promote cell-cycle arrest through the same pathway; consistent with this, p16 levels increase in response to ras in p53−/− MEFs, and p53 levels increase in p16−/− MEFs (data not shown). Thus, ras-induced accumulation is achieved by the two proteins independently of one another and, at the levels achieved, neither alone is sufficient to promote arrest. E1A is a viral oncoprotein known to inactivate Rb and to override p53-mediated arrest ( Lowe et al. 1993). In normal human fibroblasts, by contrast, independent disruption of either p53 or the p16/Rb pathway alone is not sufficient to prevent ras-induced arrest, but the E1A oncoprotein allows escape from ras-induced arrest. The differential sensitivity between human and rodent cells to individual perturbation of p53 or the p16/Rb pathway may underlie the well-known difficulty in establishing and transforming human cell lines in culture.

Several observations indicate that ras-induced arrest is not an immediate outcome of Ras signaling, but rather a cellular response to aberrant Ras activity. The immediate effect of Ras in primary cells is mitogenic, as indicated by microinjection studies in primary human and rodent fibroblasts ( 42, 64 and 59). Also, the cell-cycle arrest induced by ras in our studies is not immediate but occurs after a lag period, typically becoming complete by day 2 of the experimental scheme shown in Figure 1 (day 7 after the intitial introduction of H-ras V12). This delayed response is consistent with the existence of a homeostatic mechanism that prevents proliferation after prolonged Ras activation and that is mediated, at least in part, by the induction of p53 and p16.

Antiproliferative responses to oncogenic ras are not unprecedented. Oncogenic ras has been reported to result in proliferation arrest in REF52 fibroblasts ( 16 and 26) and in primary rat Schwann cells ( Ridley et al. 1988). Oncogenic ras also induces proliferative arrest and differentiation in two rodent cell lines, rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and mouse NIH-3T3-L1 fibroblasts ( 4, 7 and 43). However, it is important to point out that microinjection of Ras into Schwann and PC12 cells immediately results in proliferative arrest or differentiation, respectively ( 4 and 53). This is in contrast to primary fibroblasts, where microinjection of Ras initially results in proliferation ( 42 and 64) and probably reflects cell–type specific differences.

Senescence Induced by Oncogenic ras
The cell-cycle arrest induced by oncogenic ras is phenotypically similar, and perhaps identical, to cellular senescence. Senescence was originally defined by the observation that primary fibroblasts have a limited proliferative capacity that is genetically determined ( Hayflick and Moorhead 1961; Röhme 1981; Votja and Barrett 1995). At the end of their lifespan, cells undergo changes in morphology, physiology, and gene expression, and permanently cease proliferation ( Stein and Dulic 1995). In this state, cells remain metabolically active for long periods of time.

Under normal culture conditions, induction of senescence depends solely on the accumulated number of cell doublings. However, a phenotype suggestive of premature senescence can be induced following exposure of cell cultures to DNA-demethylating drugs (28 and 15), ceramide (Venable et al. 1995), or inhibitors of histone deacetylation (Ogryzko et al. 1996). In addition, the existence of multiple potential pathways that can promote senescence is supported by cell fusion studies (Votja and Barrett 1995). Based on our observations, we envision that senescence occurs not merely as a passive consequence of a cell-division counting mechanism, but rather as a dynamic response to an aggressive mitogenic stimulus. In this regard, it is possible that the normal Hayflick limit reflects the accumulated mitogenic load that occurs during the lifetime of a cell culture.

Oncogene Cooperation and Multistep Carcinogenesis
Disruption of p53 or the p16/Rb pathway in rodent cells is extremely efficient at abrogating ras-induced arrest. In fact, oncogenic ras alone transforms primary mouse fibroblasts deficient in either p53 or p16 ( 66 and 60). Hence, escape from ras-induced arrest may be sufficient for transformation by oncogenic ras. Other alterations known to cooperate with ras also disrupt p53 or the p16/Rb pathway. For example, T-antigen inactivates p53 and Rb; cyclin D1 inactivates Rb by promoting its phosphorylation; the viral oncoprotein Tax inactivates p16 ( Suzuki et al. 1996); the Cdc25A and -B phosphatases can activate CDK2, leading to Rb inactivation; and, finally, Myc activates the expression of Cdc25A and -B ( Galaktionov et al. 1996). We propose that the cell-cycle activation associated with disruption of p53 or the p16/Rb pathway is necessary for transformation by oncogenic ras.

The induction of a premature senescence program by oncogenic ras provides an explanation for the cooperation between ras and the immortalizing mutations that transform primary rodent cells (see Introduction). Mutations that facilitate immortalization may disable not only the senescence program associated with the accumulation of cell doublings but also, and perhaps more importantly, they may impair ras-induced senescence. Similarly, most spontaneously immortalized rodent cells can be transformed by ras alone, suggesting that ras-induced senescence is impaired. Indeed, mutations in p53 and p16 often occur spontaneously during the establishment of immortal cell lines ( 21, 52 and 54). The H-ras V12 allele used in this study was originally isolated from tumor-derived DNA by its ability to transform NIH-3T3 cells, an immortal rodent cell line ( Barbacid 1987). Interestingly, it is now known that NIH-3T3 cells have deleted the p16 gene ( 51 and 36).

Cell-cycle arrest in response to oncogenic ras may provide selective pressure to mutate p53 and p16 during carcinogenesis. Consistent with this view, mutation and/or amplification of K-ras and loss of p16 and p53 are extremely common in human pancreatic cancers ( 8 and 11). In colorectal cancer, mutation and/or amplification of K-ras typically precedes p53 mutation (reviewed by Kinzler and Vogelstein 1996). In animal models, p53 deficiency accelerates tumor progression in ras-transgenic mice ( Kemp et al. 1993), and mice lacking p16 rapidly develop malignant tumors by treatment with DMBA ( Serrano et al. 1996), a carcinogen that efficiently mutates H-ras (reviewed by Barbacid 1987).

It is possible that the effects of oncogenic ras expression that we observed may not precisely reflect cellular responses to ras mutation in vivo. Of note, we introduced ras into whole cell populations and, consequently, Ras levels among individual cells may vary. Yet, despite this intrinsic variability, the individual cell responses are remarkably uniform: the vast majority of cells arrest upon transduction of ras, and the arrest program is conserved between fibroblasts from three species. A similar variability in ras expression is also presumed in tumors, particularly in those tumors where ras proto-oncogenes are amplified ( Bos 1988). We speculate that the intensity of the ras oncogenic stimulus may affect the lag period that precedes the induction of the cellular antiproliferative response described here.

Concluding Remark
We demonstrate that oncogenic ras provokes premature senescence in primary rodent and human cells in association with the induction of p53 and p16. We propose that premature induction of senescence in response to abnormal mitogenic signaling is a mechanism of tumor suppression. Inactivation of this antiproliferative response allows proliferation to continue unabated in the presence of oncogenic stimuli. These observations could explain the apparent pressure to mutate genes involved in the establishment of oncogene-induced senescence, such as p53 and p16, during tumor progression.

Experimental Procedures
Retroviral Vectors
The following plasmids were used for generating retroviruses: pBabe (Morgenstern and Land 1990); pLPC (coexpresses the gene of interest from an internal CMV promoter with a puromycin resistance gene driven by the LTR); and pWZL (coexpresses the gene of interest with a selectable marker translated from an internal ribosomal entry site) (a gift of J. Morgenstern). Oncogenic ras was transduced using a pBabe-Puro-based vector expressing a human H-ras V12 cDNA (pBabe-ras), although transduction of H-ras V12 using pLPC, pWZL-Hygro, or pWZL-CD8 (pWZL8ras coexpressing a CD8 cell-surface marker) gave similar results (data not shown). pWZL-Hygro derivatives were used to generate retroviruses expressing the following proteins: an adenovirus-5 12S cDNA (pWZL12S); a human p53175H mutant (pWZLp53.175); and the p16-insensitive CDK4 R24C mutant (pWZLR24C). A pWZL-Neo derivative was used to express the ecotropic retroviral receptor (pWZL-Neo-EcoR), and a pLPC derivative was used to express cyclin D1 (pLPCD1).

Cell Culture and Preparation of MEFs
Human primary fibroblasts (IMR90, WI38) and an amphotrophic retrovirus packaging line (BING) were obtained from ATCC. REF52 cells were obtained from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. The ecotropic virus packaging line Phoenix was obtained from G. Nolan. MEFs were prepared from day 13.5 embryos derived from crosses between either p53+/− mice ( Jacks et al. 1994) or p16+/− mice ( Serrano et al. 1996). The head and the red organs were removed, then the torso was minced and dispersed in 0.1% trypsin (45 min at 37°C). Cells were grown for two population doublings and then frozen. The wild-type MEFs used for comparison were derived from the same crosses, and their behavior was identical regardless of their provenance (p53+/− cross or p16+/− cross). Human fibroblasts were used between 20 and 30 population doubling levels (PDLs); MEFs between 3 and 5 PDLs. All cultures were maintained in DMEM (GIBCO) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma). Primary human and mouse fibroblasts were subcultured 1:4 upon reaching confluence; each passage was considered two PDLs.

Retroviral-Mediated Gene Transfer
Phoenix cells (5 × 106) were plated in a 10 cm dish, incubated for 24 hr, and then transfected by calcium-phosphate precipitation with 20 μg of a retroviral plasmid (15 hr at 37°C). After 48 hr, the virus-containing medium was filtered (0.45 μm filter, Millipore) and supplemented with 4 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma) (first supernatant). Viruses were collected for an additional 8 hr as before (second supernatant). Target fibroblasts were plated at 8 × 105 cells per 10 cm dish and incubated overnight. For infections, the culture medium was replaced by the appropriate first supernatant, and then the culture plates were centrifuged (1 hr, 1500 rpm) and incubated at 37°C for 8 hr. The infection process was repeated using the second supernatant. One plate of Phoenix cells produced sufficient virus for one to two plates of target cells. Sixteen hours later, infected cell populations were purified using the appropriate selection: 2 μg/ml puromycin; 75 μg/ml hygromycin; or 200 μg/ml or 400 μg/ml G418 (IMR90 and REF52 cells, respectively). Cells infected with WZL-CD8-based vectors were gently trypsinized and purified using magnetic beads conjugated to anti-CD8 (Dynal). Multiple genes were introduced sequentially, with the appropriate drug selection between. The ecotropic retrovirus receptor was introduced into human and rat fibroblasts (IMR90, WI38, and REF52) by first infecting cell populations with an amphotropic vector (pWZL-Neo-EcoR [a gift of D. Conklin] produced in BING cells), allowing subsequent infection with ecotropic viruses.

Growth Curves
Twenty-five thousand cells per well were plated into 12-well plates. At the indicated times, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 10% formalin, and rinsed with distilled water. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma) for 30 min, rinsed extensively, and dried. Cell-associated dye was extracted with 2.0 ml 10% acetic acid. Aliquots were diluted 1:4 with H2O, transferred to 96-well microtiter plates, and the optical density at 590 nm was determined. Values were normalized to the optical density at day 0 for the appropriate cell type. Within an experiment, each point was determined in triplicate; each growth curve was performed at least twice.

Cell-Cycle Analysis
Subconfluent cultures were labeled for 4 hr with 10 μM bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU; Amersham). Cells were detached with trypsin, fixed in 50% ethanol, and treated as follows (PBS washes between each step): 0.1 mg/ml of RNase A for 30 min at 37°C; 2 M HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature; FITC-conjugated anti-BrdU (Becton Dickinson) diluted 1:5 for 1 hr at room temperature; and, finally, 5 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1 mg/ml RNAse A, 0.1% NP-40, and 0.1% trisodium citrate. Samples were analyzed by two-dimensional flow cytometry to detect both fluorescein and propidium iodide. For cytological analysis, cells were plated on coverslips, labeled with BrdU as above, and fixed in 5% acetic acid, 95% ethanol (15 min at −20°C). Positive nuclei were visualized using the Amersham cell proliferation kit, except that BrdU was detected with an FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (CalBiochem). Cells were counterstained with DAPI to identify all nuclei, and the percentage of BrdU-labeled cells (FITC/DAPI) was quantified using a fluorescence microscope. At least 200 cells were counted per sample; each experiment was performed at least twice.

Immunoblot Analysis
Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 50 mM Tris–HCl [pH 8.0], 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM EDTA). After 30 min on ice, lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Samples corresponding to 15 μg of protein (BIO–RAD protein assay) were separated on 10% or 15% SDS–PAGE gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Western blot analysis was accomplished according to standard procedures using ECL detection (Amersham). The following primary antibodies were used (1:1000 unless otherwise indicated): CM5 and CM1 (Novacastra) for human and rodent p53, respectively; 1 μg/ml WAF1 Ab1 (Oncogene Sciences) for human p21; an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (Brugarolas et al. 1995) for rodent p21; DCS-50 (Novocastra) for human p16; M-156 (Santa Cruz) for mouse p16; a mixture of 0.5 μg/ml G3–245 mouse antibody (Pharmingen) and 1:100 dilutions of the C-36 and XZ-55 hybridoma culture supernatants; and a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against GST-human cyclin A for human and rodent cyclin A. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse antibodies (Amersham) were used as secondary antibodies.

CDK2 Kinase Assays
Anti-CDK2 immunoprecipitates (Xiong et al. 1993) were washed two additional times with kinase buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl [pH 8.0], 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT), and bead suspensions (∼10 μl) were brought to 20 μl with a solution containing 2.5 μg of histone H1 (Boehringer) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and resolved on 10% SDS–PAGE gels. H1 kinase activity was quantified using a Fuji Phosphorimager.

Northern Blots
Total RNA was isolated from subconfluent cultures (Trizol, GIBCO–BRL). Ten micrograms was resolved by electrophoresis, transferred to Hybond-N+ membranes, and probed according to standard procedures. The 1 kb Pst1 fragment from v-fos (kindly provided by R. Maestro and S. Rizzo) was used to assess c-fos expression. The DNA probe for human PAI-1 was purchased from Genome Systems (clone 268918; locus N35838).

Senescence-Associated β-Galactosidase
SA-β-gal activity was detected as previously described (Dimri et al. 1995) with slight modifications. Cells were washed once with PBS (pH 7.2), fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde (PBS [pH 7.2]), and washed in PBS (pH 7.2) supplemented with 1 mM MgCl2. Cells were stained in X-gal solution (1 mg/ml X-gal [Boehringer], 0.12 mM K3Fe[CN]6, 0.12 mM K4Fe[CN]6, 1 mM MgCl2 in PBS at pH 6.0) overnight at 37°C.
