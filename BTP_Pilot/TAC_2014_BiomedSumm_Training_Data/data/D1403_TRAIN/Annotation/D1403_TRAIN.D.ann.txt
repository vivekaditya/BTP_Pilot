Cells transduced with H-ras V12 or with empty vector were plated at low density and cell numbers were counted ( Figure 2B; data not shown for WI38 cells) ... Positive nuclei were visualized using the Amersham cell proliferation kit, except that BrdU was detected with an FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (CalBiochem). Cells were counterstained with DAPI to identify all nuclei, and the percentage of BrdU-labeled cells (FITC/DAPI) was quantified using a fluorescence microscope. At least 200 cells were counted per sample; each experiment was performed at least twice | Discourse Facet:  Method_Citation | Annotator:  D, |

The following plasmids were used for generating retroviruses: pBabe (Morgenstern and Land 1990); pLPC (coexpresses the gene of interest from an internal CMV promoter with a puromycin resistance gene driven by the LTR); and pWZL (coexpresses the gene of interest with a selectable marker translated from an internal ribosomal entry site) (a gift of J. Morgenstern). Oncogenic ras was transduced using a pBabe-Puro-based vector expressing a human H-ras V12 cDNA (pBabe-ras), although transduction of H-ras V12 using pLPC, pWZL-Hygro, or pWZL-CD8 (pWZL8ras coexpressing a CD8 cell-surface marker) gave similar results (data not shown) | Discourse Facet:  Method_Citation | Annotator:  D, |

Interestingly, although both are upregulated by Ras in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) Palmero et al. 1998 and Serrano et al. 1997, it is clear that p19ARF is the critical determinant of the ensuing growth arrest | Reference Offset: ['10551-10753', '11984-12174', '33090-33236'] | Reference Text:  Furthermore, oncogenic ras also increased p16 levels. On average, p53, p21, and p16 increases ranged between 10- and 20-fold, compared to control cells and relative to the total cellular protein content ... Consequently, the G1 arrest induced by oncogenic ras is different from quiescence and is specifically characterized by the simultaneous induction of the p53 and p16 tumor suppressor proteins ...
