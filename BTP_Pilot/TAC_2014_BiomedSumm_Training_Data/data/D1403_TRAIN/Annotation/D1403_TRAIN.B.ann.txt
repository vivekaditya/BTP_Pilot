Cells transduced with H-ras V12 or with empty vector were plated at low density and cell numbers were counted ( Figure 2B; data not shown for WI38 cells) ... Twenty-five thousand cells per well were plated into 12-well plates. At the indicated times, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 10% formalin, and rinsed with distilled water. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma) for 30 min, rinsed extensively, and dried. Cell-associated dye was extracted with 2.0 ml 10% acetic acid. Aliquots were diluted 1:4 with H2O, transferred to 96-well microtiter plates, and the optical density at 590 nm was determined. Values were normalized to the optical density at day 0 for the appropriate cell type. Within an experiment, each point was determined in triplicate; each growth curve was performed at least twice | Discourse Facet:  Method_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

However, a phenotype suggestive of premature senescence can be induced following exposure of cell cultures to DNA-demethylating drugs (28 and 15), ceramide (Venable et al. 1995), or inhibitors of histone deacetylation (Ogryzko et al. 1996) ... We demonstrate that oncogenic ras provokes premature senescence in primary rodent and human cells in association with the induction of p53 and p16. We propose that premature induction of senescence in response to abnormal mitogenic signaling is a mechanism of tumor suppression. Inactivation of this antiproliferative response allows proliferation to continue unabated in the presence of oncogenic stimuli | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |
