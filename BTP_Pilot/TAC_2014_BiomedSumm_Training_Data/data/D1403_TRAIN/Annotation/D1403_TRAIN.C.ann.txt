Cells transduced with H-ras V12 or with empty vector were plated at low density and cell numbers were counted ( Figure 2B; data not shown for WI38 cells) ... Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma) for 30 min, rinsed extensively, and dried. Cell-associated dye was extracted with 2.0 ml 10% acetic acid. Aliquots were diluted 1:4 with H2O, transferred to 96-well microtiter plates, and the optical density at 590 nm was determined. Values were normalized to the optical density at day 0 for the appropriate cell type | Discourse Facet:  Method_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

This Ras-induced senescence is also accompanied by p53 induction as well as a rise in ROS levels | Reference Offset:  ['683-820', '23909-24220', '26656-26967'] | Reference Text:  The arrest induced by ras is accompanied by accumulation of p53 and p16, and is phenotypically indistinguishable from cellular senescence ... These results indicate that overexpression of PAI-1 and the presence of SA-?-gal activity are not direct consequences of oncogenic ras, but rather are associated with the arrested state induced by ras. In this regard, our observations further strengthen the association of these markers with cellular senescence ... Several observations indicate that ras-induced arrest is not an immediate outcome of Ras signaling, but rather a cellular response to aberrant Ras activity. The immediate effect of Ras in primary cells is mitogenic, as indicated by microinjection studies in primary human and rodent fibroblasts ( 42, 64 and 59) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |
