Cells transduced with H-ras V12 or with empty vector were plated at low density and cell numbers were counted ( Figure 2B; data not shown for WI38 cells) ... Twenty-five thousand cells per well were plated into 12-well plates. At the indicated times, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 10% formalin, and rinsed with distilled water. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma) for 30 min, rinsed extensively, and dried. Cell-associated dye was extracted with 2.0 ml 10% acetic acid. Aliquots were diluted 1:4 with H2O, transferred to 96-well microtiter plates, and the optical density at 590 nm was determined. Values were normalized to the optical density at day 0 for the appropriate cell type. Within an experiment, each point was determined in triplicate; each growth curve was performed at least twice | Discourse Facet:  Method_Citation | Annotator:  E, |

In a similar fashion, expression of an activated form of Ras proteins can induce senescence in some primary fibroblasts (Serrano et al., 1997). This Ras-induced senescence is also accompanied by p53 induction as well as a rise in ROS levels | Reference Offset:  ['1548-2139', '4638-5144'] | Reference Text:  Oncogenic ras efficiently transforms most immortal rodent cell lines but fails to transform primary cells ( Newbold and Overell 1983). ras cooperates, however, with certain other oncogenic alterations to transform primary rodent cells ( 35 and 56), including overexpression of c-Myc, dominant negative p53, D-type cyclins, and Cdc25A and -B, and loss of p53, p16, or IRF-1 (reviewed by 70 and 57; see also Hinds et al. 1994; 38, 66, 17 and 60). Several viral oncoproteins also cooperate with ras, including SV40 T-antigen, adenovirus E1A, human papillomavirus E7, and HTLV-1 Tax ( 70 and 57) ... Primary murine fibroblasts lacking either p53 or p16 are transformed by oncogenic ras alone ( 66 and 60) and are easily established into immortal cell lines ( 22, 45 and 60). In human cells, inactivation of p53 and/or p16 also facilitates the immortalization process ( Reznikoff et al. 1996; Rogan et al. 1996). Together, these observations suggest a role for p53 and p16 in cellular senescence and, consistent with this, p53, p21, and p16 levels and/or activity increase in senescent cells ( 2, 20 and 52) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  E, |

We demonstrate that oncogenic ras provokes premature senescence in primary rodent and human cells in association with the induction of p53 and p16.

Interestingly, although both are upregulated by Ras in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) Palmero et al. 1998 and Serrano et al. 1997, it is clear that p19ARF is the critical determinant of the ensuing growth arrest | Reference Offset:  ['20017-20478'] | Reference Text:  In agreement with previous reports ( 66 and 60), both p53−/− and p16−/− MEFs expressing H-ras V12 displayed features of oncogenic transformation (e.g., refractile morphology, loss of contact inhibition), which were apparent almost immediately after H-ras V12 was transduced (data not shown).
