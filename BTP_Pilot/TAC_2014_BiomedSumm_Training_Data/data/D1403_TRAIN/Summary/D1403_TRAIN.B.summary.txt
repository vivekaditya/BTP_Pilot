	In Serrano et al., 1997 the author report their findings that overexpression of oncogenic Ras results in the growth arrest and senescence of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF's).  By transfecting H-rasV12 the determine primary cells cease proliferation and arrest in G1 similar to serum starved cells.  Additionally, increased levels of oncogenic Ras lead to an induction of p53, p21, and p16.  Arrested cells are phenotypically identical and share many characteristics/markers with senescent cells including lack of c-fos, overexpression of PAI-1, and presence of SA-beta-gal activity. Disruption of p53 or p16 through expression of mutant and dominant negative constructs can bypass arrest and prevent senescence. Additionally, viral oncognes are also able to cooperate with Ras mutations to bypass cell-cycle arrest. This result shows the cooperation of ras mutation and p53/p16 mutation in carcinogenesis and proliferation with single mutants resulting in cell-cyle arrest. The research demonstrates the default outcome of oncogenic Ras mutation in cells with intact senescence promoting pathways. This premature induction of senescence represents a basic cellular mechanism of tumor suppression. Importantly the study shows multiple mutations are required in different pathways to overcome cellular checkpoints and allow tumor progression.
