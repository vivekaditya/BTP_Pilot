Serrano et al., 1997 SummaryExpression of oncogenic ras in primary human or rodent cells results in a cell growth arrest that is indistinguishable from cellular senescence. The effect of oncogenic ras on cell arrest was studied  in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and human primary fibroblasts (IMR90) and in the rat REF52 cell line. The ras allele H-rasV12 introduced using retroviruses. The growth of the cell populations were monitored by growth curves and by BrdU-labeling. Oncogenic ras expression was found to induce a G1 arrest. This was accompanied by an significant increase of p53 and p16, tumor suppressor proteins.The contribution of p53 and p16 to ras-induced cell-cycle arrest was examined using MEFs. The inactivation of either p53 or p16 in the rodent cells was shown to prevent ras-induced arrest. The effect of the adenovirus E1A oncogene along with ongoenic ras was studied in the same cell lines. It was found that in human cells, the expression of E1A stopped the cell-cycle arrest induced by oncogenic ras. It is suggested that ras induced cellular senescence can be prematurely activated in response to an oncogenic stimulus. It is proposed that premature induction of senescence could be a response to an aggressive mitogenic stimulus and therefore a mechanism of tumor suppression.Cell-cycle arrest in response to oncogenic ras may provide selective pressure to mutate p53 and p16 during carcinogenesis. Negation of ras-induced senescence by inactivation of either p53 or p16 may be relevant during multistep tumorigenesis.
