Serrano et al., 1997 mainly highlights the role of oncogenic ras, a proto-oncogene in senescence. Cells which stop to proliferate and attain a particular morphology are said to be in senescence. The expression of ras in primary human and rodent cells leads to G1 arrest and attain a morphology and state which is similar to cellular senescence. Also, the participation of p53 and p16 tumor suppressor genes in the expression of ras to induce senescence is the major finding of this study. Effect of oncogenic ras on cell arrest was studied using growth assays, cell cycle analysis and expression of cell cycle proteins. The relation between ras induced arrest and senescence was analyzed by different senescence associated markers. The contribution of p53 and p16 was studied in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and human primary fibroblasts (IMR90). The concept of premature induction of senescence as a mechanism of tumor suppression to control cancer was first introduced in this paper (Caron et al).
