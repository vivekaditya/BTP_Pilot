SUMMARY: Serrano et al. 2007 Serrano et al. investigated the effects of ras transformation in conjunction with activation/inactivation of tumor suppressors p53 and p16 in primary rodent and human cells.    Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer methods using an activated ras allele H-rasV12 and three established fibroblast cell systems of human (IMR90 and WI38), mouse (MEFs) and rat (REF52) origin were used for this study.   Morphological changes/observations, proliferative properties and expression of p53, p21 and p16 proteins were examined.  Ras exhibited premature senescence similar to a cell cycle growth arrest with increased levels/activity of these proteins (p53, p21 or p16).  The relationship between ras-induced cell arrest and senescence was investigated using different markers of senescence.  All three cell types were used to look at the contribution of these proteins and found that inactivation of either p53 or p16 would transform cells to proliferative or tumorigenic state in rodent cells.  The adenovirus E1A inactivation exhibited the same effect in human cells.  In conclusion they found that ras-induced cell arrest/premature senescence in primary rodent and human fibroblasts are associated with the induction of p53 and p16.
