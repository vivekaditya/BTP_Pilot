Vorrohoeve 2006Endogeneous small RNAs (miRNA) were genetically screened and studied to find the miRNAs which are related to tumorigenesis. The study is conducted in testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs). A genetic library of vectors expressing majority of human miRNAs was created and studied. miR-372 and miR-373 were identified as oncogenes which affect proliferation and tumor formation in primary human cells. The expression of miR-372 and miR-373 on proliferation, oncogenic stress and transformation on primary human cells were studied. The role of miR-372 and miR-373 in development of human cancer and their mechanism of action in p53 pathway was studied in TGCTs. The main highlight of this paper is development of miRNA-expression vector library and detection of oncogenic miRNAs using corresponding barcode arrays. Here, recognition of miR-372 and miR-373 as potential novel oncogenes which participate in TGCTs development, is the major finding.
