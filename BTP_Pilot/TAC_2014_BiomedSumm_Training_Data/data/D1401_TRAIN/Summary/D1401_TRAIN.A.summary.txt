They demonstrated that miRNA-372&3 participate in proliferation and tumorigenesis of primary human cells along with oncogenic RAS and active wild-type p53 by numbing the p53 pathway.The authors created expression library by cloning most annotated human miRNAs into their vector and made a corresponding microarray for barcode detection. Guo et al, contradicted this by stating that bead-based platform is more flexible and cost-effective for detecting barcode changes.Voorhoeve et al., observed that in response to mitogenic signals like RAS primary human cells undergo growth arrest; in contrast cells lacking p53 overcame this arrest. They demonstrated that expression of miRNA-372&3 enabled cells to continue proliferating thus causing a selective growth advantage.Voorhoeve et al., established that miRNA 371-3 cluster suppresses an inhibitor of CDK activity which is essential for development of TGCTs. On further investigation they observed that 3’UTR of LATS2 is indeed the direct target of miRNA-372&3.This article has a huge impact on society as Voorhoeve et al., have indicated that deregulated expression of miRNA-372&3 predisposes cells to carcinogenic events and these miRNA expressions must be carefully controlled during differentiation to prevent progression to cancer. Their expression library has helped in the functional annotation of miRNA encompassing other regulatory functions that result in DNA damage response, differentiation, sensitivity to growth factors, resistance to anti-cancer drugs etc.   It remains to be seen how widespread oncogenic miRNAs are; nevertheless, their study has provided a system for uncovering the roles of other miRNAs in tumorigenesis.
