Voorhoeve et al. 2006 describes a method to screen a miRNA library for its affect on cell growth. They have established a miRNA expression library containing all annotated human miRNAs and have created a microarray containing the inserts from the library to quantify miRNA expression levels. As an example or the screen strategy the authors transfect the library into a population of cells and incubate for a few weeks. By then quantifiying which miRNA construct is in abundance they are able to determine which miRNA confers a growth advantage or an ability to proliferate. They find the expression miR-372 and miR-373 is able to promote cell proliferation. Additionally, the researchers show miR372 and miR-373 are upregulated in testicular germ cell tumors, indicating the observed effect on cell proliferation is relevant to human cancer. The authors then show that LATS2, a tumor suppresor gene, contains miR-372 and miR-373 target sequences in its UTR that are able to regulate its protein levels. This provides a potential mechanism by which overexpression of miRNA can lead to cell proliferation and tumor progression. Overall the study demonstrates a method to determine miRNA function by screening for potential roles in cell growth, differentiation, or other cellular pathway that can result in a survival or proliferation difference.
