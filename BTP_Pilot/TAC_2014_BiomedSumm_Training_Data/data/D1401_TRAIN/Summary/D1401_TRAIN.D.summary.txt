VoorhoeveThe endogenous small RNAs (miRNAs) miR-372 and miR-373 were identified as each permitting proliferation and tumorigenesis of primary human cells. Evidence was found that these miRNAs participate in the development of human testicular germ cell tumors by inactivating the p53 pathway.Although only a handful of miRNSs have been determined so far, previous studies have identified miRNAs linked to carcinogenesis. This study attempted  a systematic screening approach to identify more miRNA functions. The study created a library of vectors expressing the majority of cloned human miRNAs and creating corresponding DNA barcode arrays. The methodology used to develop constructs of miR-Vec have been repeated in further studies.Using fibroblasts transduced with the oncogene RASv12 , both miR-372 and miR-373 were identified as causing cell proliferation indicating that they protect against oncogene-induced senescence in a manner similar to p53 inactivation.Using athymic nude mice, cells containing the miR-372&3 clusters were shown to grow as tumors, demonstrating tumorigenesis in cells that harbor both oncogenic RAS and active wild-type p53. By using TGCT cell lines, the study provides evidence that these miRNAs are potential novel oncogenes participating in the development of human testicular germ cell tumors by inhibiting the p53 pathway, thus allowing tumorigenic growth in the presence of wild-type p53. To see if LATS2 is a direct target of miR372&3 the miRNas were cloned downstream of the luciferase gene. Constructs bearing the LATS2 3‘UTR were studied with results demonstrating a possible direct inhibition of the expression of the tumor-suppressor LATS2.
