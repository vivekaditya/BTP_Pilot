We provide evidence that these miRNAs are potential novel oncogenes participating in the development of human testicular germ cell tumors by numbing the p53 pathway, thus allowing tumorigenic growth in the presence of wild-type p53 ... Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the expression of miR-372/3 suppresses the p53 pathway to an extent sufficient to allow oncogenic mutations to accumulate in TGCTs ... However, whereas in the majority of the cases neoplastic transformation will require inactivation of p53 (for example by expression of HPV E6, HDM2, or mutant p53), miR372&3 uniquely allowed transformation to occur while p53 was active | Discourse Facet:  Implication_Citation | Annotator:  A |
