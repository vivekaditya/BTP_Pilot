Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the expression of miR-372/3 suppresses the p53 pathway to an extent sufficient to allow oncogenic mutations to accumulate in TGCTs ... This result demonstrates the ability of miR-372 and miR-373 to overcome a p21-mediated cell cycle arrest in TGCTs and substantiates the correlation between these miRNAs, CDK and the p53 pathway | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B |

To test the sensitivity of screens with miR-Lib and miR-Array, we transduced modified primary BJ fibroblasts expressing ecotropic receptor and immortalized with hTERT (BJ/ET) with a mixture of 197 different miR-Vecs and mixed them in a ratio of 400:1 with BJ/ET cells containing both miR-Vec-311 and a knockdown construct for p53 (p53kd) (Figure 1D) ... In accordance, we observed an approximately 4-fold increase in miR-311 signal, indicating that our procedure is sensitive enough to detect mild growth differences (Figure 1E) ... After 2 or 3 weeks in culture, senescence-induced differences in abundance of all miR-Vecs were determined with the miR-Array. Figures 2C and S3 show that in three independent experiments the relative abundance of three miR-Vecs increased reproducibly in the RASV12-expressing population | Discourse Facet:  Method_Citation | Annotator:  B |

Using quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis, we observed a 2-fold effect on LATS2 RNA levels and 4- to 5-fold on protein levels by the miR-371-3 cluster (Figure 5C). As a control, we used a LATS2 knockdown construct (Figure 5F). These results show that a combined effect of RNA destruction and translation inhibition is used by miR-372&3 to silence LATS2. miR-372/3 was predicted to bind two sites in the 3′UTR of LATS2 that are highly conserved between human, mouse, and zebrafish (Figure 5D). To further substantiate LATS2 as a direct target of miR372&3, we cloned its 3′UTR downstream of the firefly luciferase gene (pGL3-LATS2). We transfected either pGL3-LATS2 or the controls pGL3-372 and pGL3-373 (containing a miR-complementary sequence in their 3′UTR) or pGL3 into Tera1 and MCF-7 cells (respectively positive and negative for miR-371-3) ( Figures 4D and S6). As predicted, the 372/373 complementary sequences mediated strong inhibition of luciferase expression in Tera1 cells. Significantly, a potent inhibition of luciferase activity was also mediated by the 3′UTR of LATS2 in either MCF-7 ectopically expressing miR-372 or in Tera1 cells but not by a construct mutated at both miR-372-predicted target sites ... Next, we tested whether LATS2 is a functional target of miR-372&3 using a YFP-competition assay. Indeed, inhibition of LATS2 conferred a growth advantage to cells expressing RASV12 (Figure 5F). The overall effect was less than the effect of the miR-Vec 373 but comparable to loss of p53. Therefore, these results point to LATS2 as a mediator of the miR-372 and miR-373 effects on cell proliferation and tumorigenicity, although they do not exclude the participation of other direct miR-targets, such as Suv39-H1, in these processes | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B |
