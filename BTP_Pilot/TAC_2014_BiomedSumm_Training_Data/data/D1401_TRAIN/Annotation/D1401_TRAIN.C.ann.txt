In this context, while the development of TGCTs would be allowed by a partial functional inactivation of p53 (see [53], [54]), such mechanism would be insufficient to counteract the pro-apoptotic function of p53 induced by a persistent damage, causing a rapid cell death | Reference Offset: ['21571-22172', '26352-26530'] | Reference Text:  Since cells expressing miR-372&3 proliferate in the presence of increased p21cip1 levels, we examined their response to damaged DNA. In the presence of both miRNAs, and irrespective of RASV12 expression, IR induced a cell cycle arrest that was indistinguishable from control cells, whereas the suppression of p53 expression allowed, as expected, continuous DNA replication (Figure 4C and data not shown). These results indicate that although miR-372&3 confer complete protection to oncogene-induced senescence in a manner similar to p53 inactivation, the cellular response to DNA damage remains intact ... Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the expression of miR-372/3 suppresses the p53 pathway to an extent sufficient to allow oncogenic mutations to accumulate in TGCTs | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C |
