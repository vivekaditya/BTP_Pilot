Together with increasingly sophisticated genetically engineered murine cancer models, human cell-based systems enable the examination of the roles of specific mutations implicated in cell transformation. Recent work indicates that a limited set of genetic changes suffice to transform human cells (Hahn et al., 1999). Specifically, the coexpression of the telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT), the SV40 Large T (LT) and small t (ST) oncoproteins, and an activated allele of H-RAS (H-RASV12) render a wide range of human cells tumorigenic ( Zhao et al., 2004).

Recently, several cell culture models of human cell transformation have been described in which primary human cells are engineered to express combinations of dominantly acting cellular and viral oncogenes and subsequently measured for anchorage-independent proliferation, an in vitro hallmark of transformation (Elenbaas et al., 2001, Hahn et al., 1999 and Zhao et al., 2004). We sought to identify short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that cooperate within the context of such a model. As >80% of cancers arise from epithelial tissues, we chose to examine cells derived from human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) to increase the probability of finding genes with relevance to epithelial cancers. The cells utilized for this screen (referred to as TLM-HMECs) were created by sequentially introducing the human telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) and the large T-antigen (LT) of SV40 into HMECs (Zhao et al., 2003) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  E, |

Particularly, in accordance with the involvement of REST4 and another C-terminal truncated REST-FS (caused by a frameshift mutation) in tumorigenesis [26]–[28], [43], we found that the usage of E5 as the last exon, which is predictive of a C-terminal truncated REST4-like protein, is differentially linked to various types of cancer | Reference Offset: ['28485-29484'] | Reference Text:  However, we hypothesized if expression of REST-FS was important to the genesis of this cancer, the mutant allele should exhibit dominant-negative activity. REST-FS lacks the C-terminal repressor domain that interacts with CoREST, a corepressor molecule that mediates transcriptional repression and silencing by REST (Andres et al., 1999). To determine if REST-FS displays properties of a dominant-negative protein, we transduced the HMEC derivative (TLM cells) used in our initial screen with wild-type or mutant REST and assessed anchorage-independent proliferation. Cells expressing REST-FS but not wild-type REST exhibited robust colony formation (Figure 4E, bottom panel). The ability of REST-FS to phenocopy the transforming activity of REST shRNAs strongly suggests that this mutant interferes with the functions of endogenous REST that restrain epithelial cell transformation.

Intriguingly, a variety of human tumors including those arising in breast, ovary, and lung activate expression of neuron-specific genes. In some instances, the inappropriate expression of these neural genes elicits an autoimmune response that culminates in neurological disorders, collectively known as paraneoplastic neurologic degenerations (PND; see Discussion) ( Albert and Darnell, 2004). Such aberrant neural gene expression suggests that these cancers harbor defects in regulators of neuronal programs. Consequently, we investigated a potential role for REST in human tumor suppression ... REST is widely expressed throughout nonneuronal tissues including the colonic epithelium (Figure S1) (Chong et al., 1995 and Schoenherr and Anderson, 1995). The above results suggest that loss of REST expression may confer a selective advantage during the evolution of tumor cells. This hypothesis predicts that cells with defective REST function may be sensitive to reconstitution of REST. We examined this prediction by ectopically expressing REST in colon cancer cells that have lost (SW1417) or retain (SW620) endogenous REST expression (Figure 4A). Exogenous REST expression elicited a mild decrease in the proliferation of SW620 colon cancer cells (Figure 4B). In contrast, ectopic REST expression significantly reduced colony formation in SW1417 cells (>50-fold; Figure 4B), indicating that these cells are highly dependent on the absence of REST for their proliferation in vitro. Coupled with the function of REST in suppressing epithelial cell transformation (Figure 1E), these data strongly support a role for REST in tumor suppression | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  E, |
