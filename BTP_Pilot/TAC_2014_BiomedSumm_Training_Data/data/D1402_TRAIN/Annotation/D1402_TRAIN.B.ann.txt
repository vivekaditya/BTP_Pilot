Specifically, the coexpression of the telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT), the SV40 Large T (LT) and small t (ST) oncoproteins, and an activated allele of H-RAS (H-RASV12) render a wide range of human cells tumorigenic ( Zhao et al., 2004). These models have facilitated the identification of candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes ( Rowland et al., 2005 and Westbrook et al., 2005).

Here, we present several lines of evidence that REST may play a role in tumor suppression in humans. First, reduced REST function (mediated by RNAi or expression of dominant-negative REST) promotes transformation of human epithelial cells. Conversely, reconstitution of REST expression elicits a dramatic proliferation defect in colon cancer cells that have lost endogenous REST function. Strikingly, an independent aCGH-based search for genomic loci characterized by recurrent microdeletions identified the REST locus as a high-confidence target in colorectal cancer. This high-confidence list includes two previously established tumor suppressors, p16INK4A and TGFβRII (Derynck et al., 2001, Ruas and Peters, 1998 and Siegel and Massague, 2003), the latter of which was also identified as a SECT gene. In addition, larger deletions encompassing the REST gene were frequent in colon tumors and tumor cell lines. Furthermore, we isolated a frameshift mutation of the REST coding region in colorectal tumor cells that displays properties of a dominant negative, transforming human epithelial cells to a level similar to REST shRNAs.
