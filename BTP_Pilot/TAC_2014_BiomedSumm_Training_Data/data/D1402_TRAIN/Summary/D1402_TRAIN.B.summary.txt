      Westbrook et al., 2005 describes an RNAi screen to search for tumor suppressors.  The authors use an engineered cell line expressing a combination of cellular and viral oncogenes making it prone to transformation.  By treating these cells, termed HMECs (human mammary epithelial cells), with shRNA the authors are able to find potential tumor suppressor genes whose knockdown allows cell transformation and proliferation leading to colony formation.  Colonies are selected and the transforming shRNAs are identified by molecular barcodes with microarrays.  Some of the genes identified have established roles in tumor suppression while others are newly implicated. The authors detail one newly discovered candidate tumor suppressor REST.  Mutation and/or depletion of REST is implicated in colon cancer and affects cell proliferation in vitro as well. REST is a transcriptional regulator of neuronal programs and its loss of function in cancer cells may explain the phenomena of paraneoplastic neurological degenerations seen in human tumors of nonneuronal origin.  Overall the study demonstrates the use of shRNA libraries to screen genes for their ability to suppress the transformation of a cancer prone cell line.
