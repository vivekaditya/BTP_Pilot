WESTBROOK ET AL., 2005 SUMMARYIn this paper RNAi based methods of genetic screening to identify genes which act as suppressors of cancer progression and transformation, is described. REST, a transcriptional repressor of neural gene expression, was found as human tumor repressor gene using primary human mammary epithelial cell and colon cancer cell lines. After identifying a number of genes from the genome library they generated, some genes were studied further for activity and their relations with cancer related pathways. This model using primary human cells and genome wide libraries has enabled genetic screening to identify new tumor suppresser genes. Also, RASA4 is reported to have implication in tumorigenesis. The strategy to identify tumor suppressor genes using in vitro model and their action in human cancer would be helpful in understanding of cancer pathology and related pathways.
