Westbrook et al. used an RNA interference (RNAi) approach and a shRNA library as a genetic screen to identify genes that suppress tumor growth/cancer transformation in epithelial cells.  They identified 25 unique shRNA with a first time barcode approach using in vitro human epithelial transformation models.    They studies pathways and other genes related to cancer including tumor suppressors, TFG-BRII, PTEN and regulators of cancer, CAPRI (RASA4) and CTNND2. They identified REST/NRSF as a candidate and thoroughly investigated its pathway in tumor suppression.  They also used array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), a successful high throughput method to confirm their identification of these genes and to characterize gene alterations.  However, the shRNA library used in the screen was not comprehensive and therefore many other SECT genes may have not been identified.  This method of using in vitro transformation and the library of shRNAs has the potential to understand other genes related to cancer and study their pathway.
