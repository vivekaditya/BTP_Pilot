Westbrook et al. 2005 reported RNA interference (RNAi)-based screening in human cell lines to identify novel tumor suppressor genes. They infected human mammary epithelial cells (TLM-HMECs) with a retroviral library of short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) and looked for clones that showed anchorage-independent growth. Their work on identifying new oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes using genetically designed primary human cells has been iterated by many researchers. The authors utilized RNAi-based, forward genetic approach to identify genes that suppress oncogenic transformation in HMECs. They identified approximately 25 potential suppressors of epithelial cell transformation (SECT) genes that represent candidate tumor suppressors. They provided evidence that one of these candidates, the transcriptional repressor of neuronal genes in non-neural tissues, REST/NRSF, plays a previously unappreciated role in tumor suppression.The authors observed deletions of varying size encompassing the REST locus on chromosome 4, in a significant proportion of tumors, suggesting that chromosomal deletions targeting the REST locus are a frequent event in colon cancer. REST knockdown promoted signaling through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, whereas expression of a dominant-negative form of the PI3K regulatory subunit inhibited REST-shRNA-induced transformation. Thus, the authors conclude that REST is a good candidate for a tumor suppressor that may act by suppressing PI3K signaling.
