Summary: Distinct Initiation and Maintenance Mechanisms Cooperate to Induce G1 Cell Cycle Arrest in Response to DNA DamageLucas Duncan	This paper was an investigation into mechanisms surrounding cell cycle arrest caused by ionized radiation, conducted by Reuven Agami and Rene Bernards. The main mechanism of genotoxic cell cycle arrest is due to the stabilization of p53. Since p53 is a transcription factor, this mechanism takes a relatively long time to act. Agami and Bernards demonstrated that, since a cellular response to DNA damage was observed in less than 10 hours in cells incapable of stabilizing p53, another, faster acting mechanism also contributes to the arrest of the cell cycle.	In cells subjected to genotoxic stress, Agami and Bernards observed a downregulation of cyclin D1. Cyclins are important in advancing the cell through the G1 phase. This downregulation was also shown to noticeably occur around 10 minutes after irradiation, making it a likely mediator for the rapid response to irradiation. 	Further investigation into the specific action of cyclin D1 degradation on cell cycle arrest revealed that proteolytic degradation is the main mechanism of this action. Specifically, the researchers identified a specific sequence of amino acids found in the cyclin D1 that suggested the degradation was both specific to cyclin D1, and mediated by APC. This process caused a short term release of p21 from the CDK4 complex, leading to the inhibition of CDK2. Disruption of the degradation sequence box and subsequent irradiation suggested that the degradation of cyclin D1 was essential to the initiation of the arrest of the cell cycle.
