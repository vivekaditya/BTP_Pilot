Agami and Bernarrds, 2000 describes the process of G1 arrest in response to DNA damage, such as ionizing radiation (IR). In response to DNA damage an initial p53 independent G1 arrest mediated by cyclin D1 proteolysis and later on p53 stability leading to the maintenance of arrest is the major finding of this paper. Induction of an initial p53 independent G1 arrest and downregulation of cyclin D1 in response to genotoxic stress (IR) were found in different cell lines using cell cycle and immunoprecipitation assays. It was found that RxxL motif is a necessary motif for cyclin D1 degradation in response to IR. The association of anaphase promoting complex (APC) with cyclin D1/CDK4 complex in cyclin D1 proteolysis was found using electroporation studies. The finding that genotoxic stress induces cyclin D1 degradation could make tumor suppression more effective by inhibiting such stimuli.
