	Agami and Bernards, 2000 reports on the mechanisms of cell cycle arrest following DNA damage.  In addition to the previously known role of p53 in iducing G1 arrest in response to ionizing radiation (IR) they also discover a p53 independent pathway.  This p53 independent pathway is immediate, happening within 10 hours of exposure to IR and does not require transcription or translation to activate.  This pathway functions in cells depleted for p53, however G1 arrest at later time points is inhibited.  This indicates a G1 arrest happens in two stages. First the initiation stage  requires destruction of cyclin D1 resulting in early onset of G1 arrest happens within 10 hours.  The second maintenance stage is the p53 mediated G1 arrest which requires transcription of p53 and comes on 10-30 hours after genotoxic exposure. The authors determine this pathway involves the proteolysis of cyclin D1 in response to genotoxic stress and is mediated through a RxxL destruction motif.  Additionally they show proteolysis of cyclin D1 may be mediated through its interaction with the anaphase promoting complex, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Overall the authors have helped elucide the cellular response to IR and discovered an additional pathway contributing to cell cycle arrest.
