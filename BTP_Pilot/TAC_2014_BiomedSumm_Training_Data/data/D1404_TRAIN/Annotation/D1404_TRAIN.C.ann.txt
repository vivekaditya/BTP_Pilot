This result suggests that cells undergo an initial G1 arrest within 10 hr after exposure to IR and that this initial response does not require p53 activity ... These results suggest that the APC is constitutively associated with the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex and are consistent with a model in which the APC is responsible for cyclin D1 proteolysis in response to IR | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

The Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC), a multimeric ubiquitin ligase complex of 1.5 MDa, is essential for destruction box-mediated degradation of mitotic cyclins (11 and 15) ... Therefore, it seems that CDK4 serves as a bridging factor between cyclin D1 and the APC. This suggests a model in which the APC marks cyclin D1 for proteolysis and is subsequently free to bind another cyclin D1 molecule via CDK4 | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

Whereas the mitogenic signals are mediated by phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at threonine 286, our data indicate that genotoxic stress requires a newly identified RxxL destruction box motif (amino acids 29–32) within cyclin D1 ...

The p16INK4A-cyclin D1-pRb pathway is disrupted in most, if not all, human tumors. In a substantial number of tumors cyclin D1 is over-expressed by one of several mechanisms (Hanahan and Weinberg 2000) ... Our findings also have potential relevance for treatment of cancer. Abrogation of genotoxic stress-induced cyclin D1 degradation sensitizes cells to genotoxic stress with no significant effect on survival of nonirradiated cells (Figure 7) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

Close inspection of the cyclin D1 protein sequence revealed that cyclin D1, but not cyclin D2 and D3, harbors a destruction box–like motif in its N terminus ( Figure 4C) ... This result demonstrates that the RxxL motif of cyclin D1 is necessary and, when placed in the context of a D-type cyclin, also sufficient to mediate degradation in response to genotoxic stress ... Our identification of the RxxL destruction motif as a necessary element for cyclin D1 degradation points to the involvement of APC in this process | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

Our finding that the genotoxic stress-induced cyclin D1 degradation pathway is intact in most tumor cells (Figure 3) may be related to the fact that disruption of this pathway does not elevate cyclin D1 protein levels in nonstressed cells (Figure 4) and therefore does not confer a selective advantage to tumor cells ... This suggests that specific inhibition of genotoxic stress induced-cyclin D1 degradation could make radiotherapy more effective and selective as tumor cells often express much higher levels of cyclin D1 than the surrounding normal tissue | Discourse Facet:  Implication_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

Degradation is mediated through a previously unrecognized destruction box in cyclin D1 and leads to a release of p21cip1 from CDK4 to inhibit CDK2 ... In response to DNA damage, such as ionizing radiation (IR), p53 is required for G1 arrest (reviewed in Lakin and Jackson 1999), apoptosis (reviewed in Sionov and Haupt 1999), and to sustain arrest of cells prior to M phase (Bunz et al. 1998). In response to IR, rapid phosphorylation of p53 by the ATM-CHK2 pathway on serines 15 and 20 leads to release of Mdm2 and stabilization of p53 (Meek 1999, and references therein) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |
