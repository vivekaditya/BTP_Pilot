Ionizing radiation was shown to activate the APC/C to degrade cyclin D1, which triggers an immediate p53-independent G1 arrest [9] | Reference Offset:  ['20464-20667', '33197-33700'] | Reference Text:  These results suggest that the APC is constitutively associated with the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex and are consistent with a model in which the APC is responsible for cyclin D1 proteolysis in response to IR ... Genotoxic stresses, such as IR, induce a fast and strong G1 arrest that is sustained over a prolonged period of time. We report here that this type of G1 arrest builds up in two different and mechanistically distinct phases: initiation and maintenance. The initial process is fast (accomplished in a period of less than 10 hr), strong (more than 15% increase in G1 in an asynchronous population), and is mediated by cyclin D1 degradation. p53 activity is dispensable for G1 arrest in this initial period | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  D, |

Alternatively, the anaphase promoting complex (APC) is responsible for the rapid degradation of cyclin D1 in cells irradiated with ionizing radiation [31] | Reference Offset:  ['20464-20667'] | Reference Text:  These results suggest that the APC is constitutively associated with the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex and are consistent with a model in which the APC is responsible for cyclin D1 proteolysis in response to IR | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  D, |

This destruction box does not play a role in the normal metabolic turn-over of cyclin D1 protein (Figure 4), but mediates rapid cyclin D1 degradation after exposure to genotoxic stress. Destruction boxes were first identified in mitotic cyclins (Glotzer et al. 1991). The Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC), a multimeric ubiquitin ligase complex of 1.5 MDa, is essential for destruction box-mediated degradation of mitotic cyclins (11 and 15) ... Our identification of the RxxL destruction motif as a necessary element for cyclin D1 degradation points to the involvement of APC in this process | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  D, |

However, two independent point mutations within the putative destruction box of cyclin D1 (either R29Q or L32A) completely abolished degradation by IR ( Figure 4B). Combining each of these mutations in the destruction box with a mutation in the GSK3-β phosphorylation site ( Figure 4B, R29Q;T286A and L32A;T286A mutants) gave rise to a higher level of protein expression in nonirradiated cells that was fully resistant to the IR effect, in sharp contrast to the T286A single mutant ( Figure 4B) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  D, |
