Ionizing radiation was shown to activate the APC/C to degrade cyclin D1, which triggers an immediate p53-independent G1 arrest [9] | Reference Offset:  ['33197-33700', '39471-39779', '40759-41113'] | Reference Text:  Genotoxic stresses, such as IR, induce a fast and strong G1 arrest that is sustained over a prolonged period of time. We report here that this type of G1 arrest builds up in two different and mechanistically distinct phases: initiation and maintenance. The initial process is fast (accomplished in a period of less than 10 hr), strong (more than 15% increase in G1 in an asynchronous population), and is mediated by cyclin D1 degradation. p53 activity is dispensable for G1 arrest in this initial period ... We demonstrate here that cyclin D1 has a functional RxxL motif, also known as a destruction box, within its amino terminus. This destruction box does not play a role in the normal metabolic turn-over of cyclin D1 protein (Figure 4), but mediates rapid cyclin D1 degradation after exposure to genotoxic stress ... In support of this view is our finding that the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex specifically associates with the APC in cycling cells (Figure 5). Whereas the interaction of APC with CDK4 remains intact in cells exposed to IR, the interaction with cyclin D1 decreases rapidly. Therefore, it seems that CDK4 serves as a bridging factor between cyclin D1 and the APC | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

Alternatively, the anaphase promoting complex (APC) is responsible for the rapid degradation of cyclin D1 in cells irradiated with ionizing radiation [31] | Reference Offset:  ['19714-20667'] | Reference Text:  Since cyclin D1 harbors a destruction box–like motif, we searched for an association of endogenous cyclin D1/CDK4 complexes with Cdc27, a conserved component of the APC (King et al. 1995). In nontransfected MCF-7 cells, we clearly and specifically detect both endogenous CDK4 and cyclin D1 proteins in Cdc27 immunoprecipitates (Figure 5A). Conversely, Cdc27 was present in cyclin D1 immunoprecipitates (Figure 5B). Moreover, Cdc27 was present in anti-CDK4 but not anti-CDK2 immunoprecipitates (Figure 5C). Significantly, the interaction between CDK4 and Cdc27 was not affected by IR (Figure 5C), whereas the amount of Cdc27 bound to cyclin D1 decreased, most likely due to degradation of cyclin D1 by IR (Figure 5B, compare upper and middle panels). These results suggest that the APC is constitutively associated with the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex and are consistent with a model in which the APC is responsible for cyclin D1 proteolysis in response to IR | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

However, two independent point mutations within the putative destruction box of cyclin D1 (either R29Q or L32A) completely abolished degradation by IR ( Figure 4B). Combining each of these mutations in the destruction box with a mutation in the GSK3-β phosphorylation site ( Figure 4B, R29Q;T286A and L32A;T286A mutants) gave rise to a higher level of protein expression in nonirradiated cells that was fully resistant to the IR effect, in sharp contrast to the T286A single mutant ( Figure 4B). These data suggest that the RxxL destruction box in cyclin D1 is the major motif that renders cyclin D1 susceptible to degradation by IR ...

DNA damage checkpoints control the timing of cell cycle progression in response to genotoxic stress (reviewed in Weinert 1998). Arrest in G1 is thought to prevent aberrant replication of damaged DNA and arrest in G2 allows cells to avoid segregation of defective chromosomes. Primary among mammalian checkpoint genes is the tumor suppressor p53. In response to DNA damage, such as ionizing radiation (IR), p53 is required for G1 arrest (reviewed in Lakin and Jackson 1999), apoptosis (reviewed in Sionov and Haupt 1999), and to sustain arrest of cells prior to M phase (Bunz et al. 1998) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

In fact, genotoxic stresses such as ionizing radiation have been demonstrated to trigger rapid proteolysis of cyclin D1, leading to p53-independent G1 arrest (25). This is in accordance with our .nding that treatment of p53-deficient cells with adriamycin caused a signi.cant decrease in cyclin D1 protein stability (Fig. 2) | Reference Offset:  ['33197-33700', '34523-35044'] | Reference Text:  Genotoxic stresses, such as IR, induce a fast and strong G1 arrest that is sustained over a prolonged period of time.

This p53 response depends on several time-consuming processes and is therefore inherently slow. Therefore, the p53 response appears more suited to maintain and further strengthen an already established G1 arrest, rather than to initiate it. This notion is supported by the present data, which show that p53 hardly contributes to G1 arrest in the first 10 hr after exposure to IR. Our results suggest strongly that the initial phase of G1 arrest following IR relies primarily on downregulation of cyclin D1 protein levels | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |
