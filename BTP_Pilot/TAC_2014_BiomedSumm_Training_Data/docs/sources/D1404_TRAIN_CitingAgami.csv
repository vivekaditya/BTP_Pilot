To assess the possibility that reduced cyclin D1 proteolysis is a putative mechanism for its accumulation during UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis, ubiquitination activity of cyclin D1 was assessed in UVB-induced murine SCCs. Cyclin D1 was rapidly ubiquitinated by control skin extract, whereas ubiquitination of cyclin D1 was significantly reduced in SCCs. Mutant cyclin D1, in which residues important for GSK3Ô_-mediated degradation of cyclin D1 are altered to non-phosphorylatable alanine, was not ubiquitinated. We also observed phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of GSK3Ô_ in SCCs. Our results indicate reduced ubiquitination of cyclin D1 in UVB-induced murine SCCs and suggest that inactivation of GSK3Ô_-dependent cyclin D1 degradation pathway contributes to the accumulation of cyclin D1 in UVB-induced murine SCCs.

Cyclin D1a and b proteins differ in their C-terminus, a region involved in protein degradation and sub-cellular localization. Recent data have suggested that cyclin D1b could be a nuclear oncogene. The presence of cyclin D1b mRNA and protein has been studied in two hemopathies in which cyclin D1 could be present: multiple myeloma (MM) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The A/G polymorphism of CCND1 has also been verified in a series of patients. Methods: The expression of cyclin D1 mRNA isoforms has been studied by real-time quantitative PCR; protein isoforms expression, localization and degradation by western blotting. The CCND1 polymorphism was analyzed after sequencing genomic DNA. Results: Cyclin D1 mRNA isoforms a and b were expressed in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and multiple myeloma (MM). Cyclin D1b proteins were present in MCL, rarely in MM. Importantly, both protein isoforms localized the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. They displayed the same short half-life. Thus, the two properties of cyclin D1b recognized as necessary for its transforming activity are missing in MCL. Moreover, CCND1 polymorphism at the exon/intron boundary had no influence on splicing regulation in MCL cells. Conclusion: Our results support the notion that cyclin D1b is not crucial for the pathogenesis of MCL and MM.

The survival rate of HL-60 cells exposed to lycorine was decreased in a dose-dependent manner with 1 Ô_M as the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), cell growth was slowed down by arresting cell cycle at G2/M phase, and cell regeneration potential was inhibited. HL-60 cells exhibited typical apoptotic morphological changes, apoptotic DNA ""ladder"" pattern, and sub-G1 peak in cell phase distribution, showing apoptosis of HL-60 cells. To further understand the apoptotic molecular mechanism of lycorine on HL-60 cells, caspase activity was tested by colorimetric assay, and the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins was examined by Western blotting. The increase of caspase-8, -9, -3 activities demonstrated that caspase was a key mediator of apoptotic pathways induced by lycorine. Under-expression of Bcl-2 and increase of Bax:Bcl-2 ratio showed that Bcl-2 family proteins were involved in apoptosis. Our finding suggests that lycorine can suppress leukemia growth and reduce cell survival via arresting cell cycle and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells.

We previously demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated wild-type p53 gene transfer could enhance the cytotoxic actions of chemotherapeutic drugs both in vitro and in vivo; however, the molecular mechanism of this chemosensitization is still unclear. Cyclin D1 is a major regulator of the progression of cells into the proliferative stage of the cell cycle. Here we show that infection with an adenovirus vector expressing the wild-type p53 gene (Ad-p53) caused an increase in cyclin D1 protein levels in human colorectal cancer cell lines DLD-1 and SW620; treatment with the anti-cancer drug adriamycin, however, down-regulated their cyclin D1 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. The suppression of cyclin D1 expression following adriamycin treatment could be blocked by simultaneous Ad-p53 infection. Furthermore, DLD-1 and SW620 cells transfected with the cyclin D1 expression construct displayed increased sensitivity to adriamycin compared to that of the vector-transfected control. Our results suggest that ectopic wild-type p53 gene transfer results in increased cyclin D1 expression and, consequently, sensitizes human colorectal cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents.

While the number of verified human miRNAs is still expanding, only few have been functionally annotated. To perform genetic screens for novel functions of miRNAs, we developed a library of vectors expressing the majority of cloned human miRNAs and created corresponding DNA barcode arrays. In a screen for miRNAs that cooperate with oncogenes in cellular transformation, we identified miR-372 and miR-373, each permitting proliferation and tumorigenesis of primary human cells that harbor both oncogenic RAS and active wild-type p53. These miRNAs neutralize p53-mediated CDK inhibition, possibly through direct inhibition of the expression of the tumor-suppressor LATS2. We provide evidence that these miRNAs are potential novel oncogenes participating in the development of human testicular germ cell tumors by numbing the p53 pathway, thus allowing tumorigenic growth in the presence of wild-type p53.

This protein is reported to be degraded following phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) on Thr-286. We recently showed that phosphorylation of Thr-286 is responsible for a decline in cyclin D1 levels during S phase, an event required for efficient DNA synthesis. These studies were undertaken to test the possibility that phosphorylation by GSK3 is responsible for the S phase specific decline in cyclin D1 levels, and that this event is regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway which controls GSK3. Results: We found, however, that neither PI3K, AKT, GSK3, nor proliferative signaling activity in general is responsible for the S phase decline in cyclin D1 levels. In fact, the activity of these signaling kinases does not vary through the cell cycle of proliferating cells. Moreover, we found that GSK3 activity has little influence over cyclin D1 expression levels during any cell cycle phase. Inhibition of GSK3 activity by siRNA, LiCl, or other chemical inhibitors failed to influence cyclin D1 phosphorylation on Thr-286, even though LiCl efficiently blocked phosphorylation of Ô_-catenin, a known substrate of GSK3. Likewise, the expression of a constitutively active GSK3 mutant protein failed to influence cyclin D1 phosphorylation or total protein expression level. Conclusion: Because we were unable to identify any proliferative signaling molecule or pathway which is regulated through the cell cycle, or which is able to influence cyclin D1 levels, we conclude that the suppression of cyclin D1 levels during S phase is regulated by cell cycle position rather than signaling activity. We propose that this mechanism guarantees the decline in cyclin D1 levels during each S phase; and that in so doing it reduces the likelihood that simple over expression of cyclin D1 can lead to uncontrolled cell growth.
